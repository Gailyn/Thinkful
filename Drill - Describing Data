1) 14+12+11+10+8+8+6 = 69 
  mean = 9.86
  median = 10
  mode = 8

  df = pd.DataFrame()
  df['ages'] = [14, 12, 11, 10, 8, 8, 6]
  np.var(df.ages)
  variance = 6.408

  np.std(df.ages)
  standard deviation = 2.531435020952764

  np.std(df['ages'] ,ddof=1) / np.sqrt(len(df['ages']))
  standard error = 1.03

2)  I would use the mean and the standard deviation to describe the data. The sample is small so the outliers have a greater 
  impact on the variance. The data has a normal distruitbution so the mean and the standard deviation would fairly
  explain the majority of the data. 


3) 14+12+11+10+8+8+7 = 70
  mean = 10
  median = 10
  mode = 8

  df = pd.DataFrame()
  df['ages'] = [14, 12, 11, 10, 8, 8, 7]
  np.var(df.ages)
  variance = 5.408

  np.std(df.ages)
  standard deviation = 2.32

  np.std(df['ages'] ,ddof=1) / np.sqrt(len(df['ages']))
  standard error = .95 

  The mean increased
  the variance decreased
  standard deviation decreased
  standard error decreased 


4) Changing the age of 8 to 1 creates drastic change in the variance, standard error, and mean value.
I would use the mean and standard deviation.

5) I would guess 20% of people were fans, an average of the popular magazine samples. 
I  excluded the sci-fi magazine as that would have a high sample bias.
